so far everything has not been too much trouble;  an occasional stupid mistake with spelling or something

finally appear to be getting the hang of this

really want to get the email thing figured out;  tried setting up a yahoo account because I thought
it would be the simplest way to send email;  Google is now generally set up for 2-factor authentication
and Outlook is also not seemingly allowing my smtp through;  maybe the professor can help figure it out
otherwise I will just be using the console method to display what I need to

not going to put twitter in my setup since I refuse to get a twitter account; facebook and google+ are set up though and it works great

finished up chapter 5 without too much complication, although you have got to be sure you recognize at what folder level he tells you to 
add something because it can totally screw your whole project up and really mess up your sanity and confidence

chapter 6 was also relatively easy, although sometimes I wonder how I keep missing such little things

I am concerned that the other images I bookmarked never show up properly on the list, only the very first one he has you bookmark
